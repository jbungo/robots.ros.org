introduction: Co-developed by NVIDIA and the robotics department at California Polytechnic State University, ‘Jet’ is a smart, autonomous robot based on the NVIDIA Jetson embedded development platform utilizing Servocity Acotobotics components. Jet’s brain is built around the NVIDIA Tegra SoC and uses the same NVIDIA computing cores designed into supercomputers. This gives Jet compute-intensive computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and self-driving capabilities in a low-cost package.
